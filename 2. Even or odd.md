# 2. Even or odd

What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

````
function isEven(value) { 
  if (value % 2 === 0) { 
    return true; 
  } else 
  return false; 
}
````

This has a constant time complexity of O(1) because the function requires the same amount of operations regardless of the input. You will only ever have one number input, and the function will always perform the same action
