# 7. Compute the sequence
What does the following algorithm do? What is its runtime complexity? Explain your answer

````
function compute(num) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {

        if (i === 1) {
            result.push(0);
        }
        else if (i === 2) {
            result.push(1);
        }
        else {
            result.push(result[i - 2] + result[i - 3]);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
````

This function has a time complexity of `O(n)` linear because we are looping through the result array
on the first iteration, `0` is pushed to the end of the array
on the next iteration `1` is push to the array
then each additional number pushed into the array is the next value in the Fibonnaci sequence
