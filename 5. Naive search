5. Naive search
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function naiveSearch(array, item) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] === item) {
            return i;
        }
    }
}


This function also has linear time complexity because the amount of time it takes to get to the output is directly proportional to the size of the input
