9. Random element
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function findRandomElement(arr) {
    return arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];
}

This algorithm has a constant time of O(1).  The function must pick a random integer within a range, and then retrieve the item in the array at that index. Neither of these operations depends on input size.
