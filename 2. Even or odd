2. Even or odd
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function isEven(value) { if (value % 2 === 0) { return true; } else return false; } }

This has a a polynomial time complexity of O(1) because the function is constant. You will only ever have one number input, and the function will always perform the same action
