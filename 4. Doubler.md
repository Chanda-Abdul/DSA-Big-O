# 4. Doubler
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

````
function doubler(array) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        array[i] *= 2;
    }
    return array;
}
````


This function has a linear time of `O(n)`, because the function has a running time that is directly proportional to the size of the input
