4. Doubler
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        array[i] *= 2;
    }
    return array;
}


This function has a linear time of O(2), because the function has a running times that is directly proportional to the size of the input
