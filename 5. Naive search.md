# 5. Naive search
What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

````
function naiveSearch(array, item) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] === item) {
            return i;
        }
    }
}
````


This function also has O(n) linear time complexity because the amount of time it takes depends on the number of elements in the array
